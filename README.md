## 🪐 About

**Cosmos** is a modern, single-page space education website designed to make the wonders of the observable universe feel accessible, beautiful, and immersive. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no libraries — just clean code and a passion for space. 🚀

The site blends a refined **glassmorphism** aesthetic with deep-space visuals, featuring an animated starfield canvas, soft nebula orbs, and smooth scroll-triggered reveal animations — all grounded in a dark, atmospheric colour palette inspired by the night sky. 🌠

## ⚡ Features

- ⭐ **Animated Starfield** — A live canvas-rendered starfield with 300+ individually twinkling stars, fixed to the background throughout the entire page
- 🔮 **Glassmorphism Design** — Every card, panel, and section uses frosted-glass styling with `backdrop-filter` blur, subtle borders, and layered transparency
- ⚫ **Cosmic Phenomena Section** — Six detailed cards covering Black Holes, Neutron Stars, Dark Matter, Supernovae, Gravitational Waves, and Cosmic Inflation
- 📊 **Universe Stats Row** — Key cosmological figures presented in a clean, editorial grid
- ☀️ **Animated Solar System** — A CSS-powered orrery with orbiting planets and a breathing sun, accompanied by scientific facts about our solar system
- 🌌 **Deep Space Facts** — An editorial mosaic layout exploring scale, distance, and the sheer incomprehensible size of the universe
- 💜 **Nebula Atmosphere** — Three drifting radial gradient orbs (blue, purple, teal) layered behind all content for depth and atmosphere
- 🎞️ **Scroll Reveal Animations** — Sections fade and rise into view as you scroll using IntersectionObserver
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** — Adapts gracefully to all screen sizes including mobile
